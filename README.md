### Rodrigues' Formula

**Rodrigues' Formula** is a method used in mathematics to generate specific types of polynomials, often known as orthogonal polynomials, which are particularly important in physics, engineering, and statistics. The formula provides a systematic way to construct these polynomials, especially for families such as Legendre, Hermite, and Laguerre polynomials, which commonly appear in solutions to differential equations in quantum mechanics, optics, and other scientific fields.

By applying Rodrigues' formula, each polynomial in the sequence can be generated explicitly, making it easier to compute and analyze their properties. These polynomials have the useful feature of being orthogonal, which means they can represent complex functions or data in simpler terms, much like Fourier series.

- Jacobi polynomials
- Legendre polynomials
- Chebyshev I polynomials
- Hermite polynomials
- Laguerre polynomials

### Sturm–Liouville theory

**Sturm–Liouville Theory** is a mathematical framework used to analyze certain types of differential equations that are essential in many fields, including physics, engineering, and applied mathematics. This theory helps solve problems where functions need to satisfy specific boundary conditions, such as those encountered in vibration analysis, heat transfer, and quantum mechanics.

A key aspect of Sturm–Liouville theory is its ability to generate special functions, known as eigenfunctions, which are "orthogonal." This means they are independent from each other and can form a basis to represent other functions in the space. By applying this theory, complex functions or data can be expressed in simpler terms, similar to breaking down signals into sine and cosine waves in Fourier analysis. This makes Sturm–Liouville theory a powerful tool for solving partial differential equations in cases where boundary values play a crucial role.
